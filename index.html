		<h2>Message to Amma</h2>
		<p>Amma I know you can't read this but God didn't give me a chance to talk to you before you passed away. I just wanna tell you, no matter what I did, even though my actions may have seemed that I didn't love you, remember maa, I loved you to the core. No one can give me the amount of love you gave me. I took you for granted and you taught me a lesson. After this I won't take anyone for granted in my life. Amma, I miss you, I miss your voice, your hug and your heartbeat. I won't get all these after this. But I will continue what you have left and make you proud amma. I love you. Take care up there. Muaxxx</p>
